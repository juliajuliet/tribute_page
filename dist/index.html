      <h2> Intersting facts about Marie's life: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>7 November 1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire. Her farther taught mathematics and physics, once he brought home labaratory equipment and taught his children, including Marie, how to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - She earned money for university (worked as a governess and educate herself for a few years) and enroll to University of Paris, where she studied mathematics, physics and chemistry</li>
        <li><strong>1893</strong> - Awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894. At this time, she met her future husband Pierre Curie</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - Marie married to Pierre and became Marie Skłodowska-Curie. He was her love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator</li>
        <li><strong>1897</strong> - Marie born a daughter and began teaching at the École Normale Supérieure. At the same time, she worked in 'labaratory' (which was a shed without ventilation and wasn't waterproof) and researched uranium rays. She and her husband didn't know that its radioactive! </li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong> - she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. The scientist also opened a new element radium and discovered radioactivity. <br><i>"The [research] idea was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved' -said one of her collegue.</i></li>
        <li><strong>1900</strong> - Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure </li>
        <li><strong>1903</strong> - the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics. <i><strong>Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize</strong></i>. Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work</li>
        <li><strong>1904</strong> - Curie gave birth to their second daughter</li>
        <li><strong>1906</strong> - death of Marie's husband. On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.<strong><i>She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris</strong></i></li>
        <li><strong>1910</strong> - Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions</li>
        <li><strong>1911</strong> - the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <i>She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each</i></li>
        <li><strong>World War I</strong> - After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies").</li>
        <li><strong>1921</strong> - U.S. President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States, and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife</li>
        <li><strong>1922</strong> - she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia</li>
        <li><strong>4 July 1934</strong> - She died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow</li>
      </ul>

        <blockquote>
          "The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked"
